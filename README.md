## Contest mode for Reddit submissions

This is a Python bot for Reddit.

The bot checks recently added posts in a certain timeframe (1 day by default), picks the best one by the number of upvotes
and makes it sticky + flaired as "Best of 24h" (or whatever flair moderators pick).

It rechecks subreddits every minute so that the contest is continuous.
